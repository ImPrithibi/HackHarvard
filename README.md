# HackHarvard
HackHarvard is an annual collegiate hackathon (i.e. coding competition) that brings together students from around the world to collaborate and create innovative projects related to hardware, software, computer coding, and more

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project was to create a robust backend solution that could seamlessly run locally or virtually using server.js, while utilizing MySQL to efficiently store user login credentials and related data.

## What it does
Our project serves as a backend infrastructure that securely stores user login information, including usernames and passwords, within a MySQL database. The heart of our system is the server.js file, which facilitates the operation of the server.

## How we built it
Our project is built using JavaScript, with server.js serving as the backbone of our server operations. We have integrated MySQL to ensure reliable and scalable data storage for user credentials and related information.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the challenges we encountered during the development process was our initial intention to create a frontend interface for user interaction. Unfortunately, due to various errors and bugs, we were unable to successfully implement the frontend as initially planned.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take pride in having successfully created a fully functional backend system that can power the game of our choice. Our backend infrastructure is reliable, secure, and ready to handle the demands of the gaming experience.

## What we learned
Throughout the project, we gained valuable insights into the versatility of JavaScript, which can be utilized to run servers alongside MySQL for efficient data storage. This knowledge will undoubtedly serve us well in future endeavors.

## What's next for Backend for Game
In the future, we plan to develop a fully functional frontend interface to seamlessly connect our game server with the database. This will enable us to create a complete and engaging gaming experience for users, complete with a proper game interface.
